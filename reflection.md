Reflection

Personally I really liked what this project taught me with using p5 play.
Even though the project really relied on it for the physics, I personally
think it taught me a lot with the interactions I needed to program. I 
managed to get all of my "needs to have". I would've liked to give it 
more polish but I got the core of the game done and I'm happy with that.
